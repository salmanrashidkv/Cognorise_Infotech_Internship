# Machine Learning Internship at CognoRise InfoTech
Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the work I've undertaken during my internship at CognoRise InfoTech in the domain of machine learning. Below, you'll find a summary of the three tasks I've accomplished, along with a brief description of the methodologies employed and algorithms utilized.

### Task 1: Email Spam Detection
Objective:
Develop model to classify emails as either spam or not spam based on their content, employing various machine learning algorithms.

Key Achievements:
- Extracted features and dataset characteristics for insights.
- Applied stemming and tokenization to the target variable for enhanced text data efficiency.
- Performed vectorization of the target variable, utilized TF-IDF for effective text-to-number conversion.
- Employed algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Adaboosting Classifier, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision and recall, considering the balance between identifying spam and avoiding false positives.

### Task 2: Diabetes Prediction
Objective:
Develop predictive models to determine whether a person has diabetes based on relevant features such as glucose levels and BMI, utilizing machine learning algorithms.

Key Achievements:
- Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of features in the dataset.
- Preprocessed the data by handling missing values, scaling features, and addressing any outliers.
- Utilized machine learning algorithms including Random Forest Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Adaboosting Classifier, Linear Regression, and Decision Tree Classifier.
- Evaluated and compared the performance of each algorithm using metrics such as accuracy and precision.
- Identified important features and model predictions to provide insights into the predictive factors for diabetes.

### Task 3: Digit Recognizer
Objective:
Construct a robust digit recognition model using machine learning, by training a neural network on the MNIST dataset, which consist of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9.

Key Achievements:
- Preprocessed the image data by normalizing pixel values, handling any missing information, and reshaping the images appropriately.
- Designed and implemented a neural network architecture suitable for digit recognition, considering a simple feedforward network.
- Trained the neural network using appropriate optimization algorithms and loss functions.
- Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy and visualized model predictions and looked for misclassifications.
- Visualized confusion matrix as heatmap, offering a more intuitive and appealing representation of classification performance.


## General Overview:
- Over the course of the internship, I took responsibilities such as dataset cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model creation, contributing to a comprehensive skill set in the domain of machine learning.
- Demonstrated ability to utilize spectrum of algorithms, mainly on classification but also understanding different regression tasks, showcasing adaptability to diverse challenges.
- The internship has allowed for a nuanced exploration of various facets of machine learning. I feel confident to explore more complex tasks individually for more detailed understanding of the approaches taken, utilizing the skills developed during the program.
